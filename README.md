## React ecommerce
Project created for a 4-days React bootcamp, including the use of Material Design components (https://material-ui.com/).

It consists of:
- Main page: listing all available products.
- Shopping cart: page listing all the products added to the cart.
- Form: in order to include new products.

Both shopping cart and main page give the possibility to change the view from "list" to "grid" in desktop (only list style for mobile).
